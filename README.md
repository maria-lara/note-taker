# note-taker

## Description
The purpose of this project was to build an application for note taking. Users can add notes, save those notes, and go back and delete them later. Once the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that can be viewed in any browser to display each employee as a profile.

This project was generated using Node.js and utilizes the Inquirier package and Eexpress.
